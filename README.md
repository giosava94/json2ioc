This project uses JSON configuration files to create substitutions and start command files. It can optionally compile the project for you.
It is based on the files generated by the makeBaseApp.pl command and strongly relies on the comments inside them.

## USAGE

Run inside main folder of the target IOC

```
json2ioc
```

The command can be execute outside the target folder specifying the correct parameters.

### PARAMETERS

Users can customize both input and output paths. Here we presents the main arguments users can pass to the app:

- `-c`, `--config`: path to the folder with the configurations. By default the app will search in the working directory the `json_config` folder and will consider each **.json** file as a configuration file. For each one of them the app will create a substitutions and a start command file. Users can specify a different folder from where to load the configurations. This folder can be inside or outside the current directory. With the same instruction they can load a specific configuration instead of a entire folder.
- `m`, `--make`: flag to compile the IOC once the substitutions and start command creation ended.
- `-o`, `--subs-out`: path to the folder where to generate the **.substitutions** files and with the Makefile to update in order to add the new substitutions file. By default it is the `*App/Db/` directory. In order to edit the Makefile the app expects it to be the same generate from the `makeBaseApp.pl` command. Users can specify a different target folder. This folder must contain a Makefile copied from the one mentioned before.
- `-O`, `--st-cmd-out`: path to the folder where to generate the **.cmd** files. By default it is the `iocBoot/ioc*/` directory. This folder must contain a Makefile copied from the one mentioned before.
- `-t`, `--subs-template`: **.substitutions** template. By default the app will search the `template.substitutions` file inside the `*App/Db/` directory. Users can specify a custom template file. The path to that file must be given with respect to the current directory.
- `-T`, `--st-cmd-template`: **.cmd** template. By default the app will search for the `st.cmd` file inside the `iocBoot/ioc*/` directory. This file is expected to be the `st.cmd` file generated by the `makeBaseApp.pl` command. Users can specify a custom start command template. The path to that file must be given with respect to the current directory.
- `-w`, `--workspace`: path to the working directory. By default it is the folder where the script is executed. The target folder must be a folder containing an EPICS IOC. This is essential to correctly update the Makefile. All default values defining file destination folders will use as reference the given working directory (if not given it is the directory where the command was executed).

### POSSIBLE USE CASES

Execute the app

- Inside/Outside the target IOC.
- Inside/Outside the target IOC with the user specifying custom paths for one or more input files.
- Inside/Outside the target IOC with the user specifying custom paths for one or more output files.
- Inside/Outside the target IOC with the user specifying custom paths for all or a subset of input and output files.
